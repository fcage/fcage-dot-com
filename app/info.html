          <p>I love experimenting with new story forms, but I think it’s important to test whether the form worked. This includes ad hoc user testing before launch and user behavior tracking after launch.<p/>

          <p>Mekong: a river rising is a recent example where colleagues across several departments were asked to view multiple iterations of the project during development to understand the level of guidance readers needed to understand the card-based navigation. Post-launch analysis was used to understand that, yes indeed, this choose your own adventure experience was much more effective than a scrolly article on mobile.</p>
